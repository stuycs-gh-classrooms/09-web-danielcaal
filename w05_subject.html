    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Stuyvesant Seekers is a Christian club under the organization of <a href="">Seekers Christian fellowship</a> which helps Christian clubs around the city. </br> At Stuy we hold meetings every Tuesday and Friday which include songs, study, fellowship and prayer. </br> Though it is a Christian club, all who are curious about Christianity are welcome.</p>
    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <p>our mission is to create a safe space where civil discussion about religious topics and God can exist. We aim to help Christians grow in their faith and form close friendships with others. It is for Christians seeking fellowship and people curious about our faith. Find out more of our mission on <a href="">Stuy Activities</a></p>
